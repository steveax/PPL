# PPL

This the repo I'm using for [a probabalistic programming class](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150PP/)

## Usage

Most of this so far is in Clojure and you need [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) installed to run it.  You can also do this with Homebrew `brew install leiningen`.

You can either run what is here using `lein repl` and call the functions interactively.  For ds, the Monte Carlo dice game simulaiton, typing `lein run num-trials` in the command line will generate a pie chart with the expected distribution of first, second, third, and fails amongs that many trials.
